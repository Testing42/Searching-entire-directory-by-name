Set-Location -Path E:\ #set this for the root folder in the file

$filename = '*TDPS000PQ.SEL*'#you can use wildcards here for name and for extension. type in what your searching for in the '* *'

$searchinfolder = 'E:\'   #set this for the root folder in the file again I know its redundant but do this again.

Get-ChildItem -Path $searchinfolder -Filter $filename -Recurse | %{$_.FullName}
